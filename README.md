## How Build and run with Docker

Clone the repository with the command above and run in the root folder the command
`docker-compose up`
This will make docker downloads all the file needed and start building the containers. 
After that, you can browse to http://localhost/ to use the app.

## Run test on the host machine

You can't without docker this time, to run it on the host machine without docker you can run the monolith version
available [here](https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/GoOutSafe_Primer2020)

## Developing

Each programmer has a personal style on write code and we accept this, but to make readability the
code from all component of the team, we used a good tool to format the code in automatically.

It is [black](https://github.com/psf/black), and it is installed with the requirements.txt

To format the code you can run the command below after `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user`

`black monolith`
