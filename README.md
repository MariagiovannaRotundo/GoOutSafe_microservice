## How clone it

Each microservices is a separate repository that you can clone with the following commands

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/GoOutSafe_microservice.git
```

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3797061/7290562)

The submodules are the microservices with the following proprieties:

- [Email Microservices](https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/email_microservice): Running on port 5001 and include some [celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) tasks.
- [User Microservices](https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/users_microservice): Running on port 5002;

- [Booking Microservice](https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/booking_microservice): Running on port 5004

## How Build and run with Docker

Clone the repository with the command above and run in the root folder the command
`docker-compose up`
This will make docker downloads all the file needed and start building the containers. 
After that, you can browse to http://localhost/ to use the app.

## Run test on the host machine

You can't without docker this time, to run it on the host machine without docker you can run the monolith version
available [here](https://github.com/GreyTeam2020/GoOutSafe_Primer2020)

## Developing

Each programmer has a personal style on write code and we accept this, but to make readability the
code from all component of the team, we used a good tool to format the code in automatically.

It is [black](https://github.com/psf/black), and it is installed with the requirements.txt

To format the code you can run the command below after `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user`

`black monolith`
